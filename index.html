                            <h2>About Myself</h2>
                            <p>Hi! My name is Haowen, I am currently a student in my first year of studies in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and i am in the course Information Technology. A little information on myself, my hobbies include playing video games, listening to music and reading during my free time. Most of the games i play are mostly FPS games aka First Person Shooters such as Counter Strike and Valorant but i also play some RPG games which is also known as Role Playing Games.</p>

                            <p>I first joined an IT course because i was always curious about how many things in the IT world worked such as computers, servers, etc. This all started when i got my first laptop which was passed down to me by my mother and from then on i started having in interest in the inner workings of electronic devices.</p>

                            <p>My interest in IT was further ignited when I joined ITE in the course IT Systems and Network, where i got the chance to learn more electronic devices in general such as Desktops, Routers, Switches.</p>
